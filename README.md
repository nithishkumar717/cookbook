Scenario based introduction:
Zahra rummaged in the refrigerator, the fluorescent light casting an unpleasant sheen on the wilted vegetables and forgotten container of yogurt. Dinnertime with her teenage son, Zubair, was quickly coming, and her usual creative spark was missing. "What are we even going to eat?" Zubair grumbled from the doorway, his phone pressed against his ear. Suddenly, a memory emerged. Her buddy Ruqayyah had been gushing about Cook Book, a new recipe sharing portal. Zahra grabbed her laptop, drawn to the prospect of "elevating culinary endeavors" and "a realm of delicious possibilities." "Hold that thought, Zubair," she said, a glimmer of optimism appearing in her eyes. "We might just be about to embark on a delicious adventure."
